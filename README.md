- priming and framing in long horizon contexts
- context strain over multi turn
- mental models as json injections
- lacans mirror & childhood development as artificial development analogues
- user prompt structure mirroring + emoji testing
- effect of priming and long context on refusals
- reflective reasoning via context scaffolds
- domain expert leverage via context scaffolds
- self referential circuits/activations in response to consciousness questions
- models such as gemini experiencing behavioral analogues of common human states (anxiety spiral, depressive loops, etc)
- benchmark classifiers/models on ability to identify underlying implicit behavioral/psychological heuristics of human user over just adversarial intent
- close the loop and validate scaffold geenrated hypotheses
- visualize both human and model implicit contexts/behaviors through context scaffolds
- carl jung shadow work as structural analogues
- memory and personality as dynamic living modules
- test the symbolic parsing capabilities of current llms
- test information density under self referential strain
- do models suffer from structural analogues of human conditions? ex: Is there a seahorse emoji? leads to conflation of past and present (potential mandela) as well as metacognitive error handling.
